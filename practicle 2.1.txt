Design and Develop SQLDDL statements which demonstrate the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, different constraints etc.


CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    DateOfBirth DATE,
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
);
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Email
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname ON Employees (LastName);
CREATE SEQUENCE seq_employee_id
START WITH 1
INCREMENT BY 1;
CREATE SYNONYM EmpSynonym FOR Employees;
ALTER TABLE Employees
MODIFY Email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL;
ALTER TABLE Employees
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_dateofbirth CHECK (DateOfBirth < '2004-01-01');
